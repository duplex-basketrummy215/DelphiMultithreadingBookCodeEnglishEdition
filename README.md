# Delphi Multithreading: Threads, Concurrency, Parallelism and Asynchronous Programming - Official Source Code

[Repositório da Edição em Português: https://github.com/cesarliws/DelphiMultithreadingBookCode](https://github.com/cesarliws/DelphiMultithreadingBookCode)

This repository contains all the source code for the practical examples in the book **"Delphi Multithreading: Threads, Concurrency, Parallelism and Asynchronous Programming,"** written by Cesar Romero.

## 📖 About the Book

A frozen interface during a long-running operation is the silent enemy of any modern application. This book is the definitive map for mastering concurrent programming in Delphi, guiding the reader from the fundamentals of the classic `TThread` to the mastery of the modern Parallel Programming Library (PPL).

Drawing on 30 years of experience in software architecture, this work is designed to be a complete training course, guiding both the programmer taking their first steps into threads and the architect seeking to optimize performance in high-demand scenarios. By the end of this journey, you will have the confidence and architectural vision to design and build Delphi applications that don't just work—they delight users with their performance and responsiveness.

## 🚀 About the Projects

This repository is organized into folders by chapter, corresponding to the book's structure. Each example project has been carefully crafted to demonstrate a specific concurrency concept in a practical and isolated manner.

  * **Chapter 1: Introduction to Concurrent and Asynchronous Processing**
      * Demonstrates the "UI Freeze" problem and introduces fundamental theoretical concepts.
  * **Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Threads in Delphi (Basic `TThread`)**
      * Practical examples of creation, lifecycle management, and safe communication with the UI using `Synchronize` and `Queue`.
  * **Chapter 3: Thread Synchronization**
      * Projects demonstrating the use of each synchronization primitive: `TCriticalSection`, `TMonitor`, `TMutex`, `TSemaphore`, `TEvent`, `TLightweightMREW`, `TCountdownEvent`, and `WaitForMultipleObjects`.
  * **Chapter 4: Thread Management and Cancellation**
      * Implementation of patterns for pausing, resuming, and cooperative cancellation (`Terminate`, `TCancellationToken`), as well as exception handling and retry strategies.
  * **Chapter 5: Asynchronous Alternatives**
      * Exploration of asynchronous techniques beyond `TThread`, including communication via `PostMessage` and the Pub/Sub pattern with `System.Messaging`.
  * **Chapter 6: Parallel Programming Library (PPL)**
      * Demonstrations of the PPL's power with `TTask`, `IFuture<T>`, `TParallel.For`, and the coordination of multiple tasks.
  * **Chapter 7: Advanced Threading Topics**
      * Projects that explore building a custom thread pool, using `TInterlocked` for extreme performance, and advanced PPL management.
  * **Chapter 8: Best Practices and Debugging**
      * Examples that consolidate architectural best practices, such as decoupling threads, using `threadvar`, and preventing deadlocks.
  * **Chapter 9: Threads in Mobile Applications (Android and iOS)**
      * FMX projects that solve real-world challenges, like parallel REST requests and processing gallery images without freezing the UI.
  * **Chapter 10: Useful Examples with PPL**
      * Implementation of complex architectural patterns, such as batch file processing, consuming paginated APIs, and pipelines with a state machine.
  * **Chapter 11: Practical Database Applications**
      * The culmination of the book: a complete project demonstrating a senior-level concurrent architecture for database access, using the PPL, Repository, Factory, and Dependency Injection patterns.
